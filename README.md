# DocsProject

This repository contains Groovy source code for two classes:

* `Light`
* `MyCoolLight`

It also contains the class `TestApp` that shows basic usage of these classes.

Your assignment is to document this project by updating the `docs/ProjectDocumentation.md` file.
The audience for this documentation will be fellow developers who want to do cool things with the lights.

Specific topics covered by the documentation should include:

* How to install and run the application (hint: it requires Groovy and Gradle, and utilizes the `application` Gradle plugin)
* What the `Light` and `MyCoolLight` classes do and how to use them
* Documentation for the public APIs in the `Light` and `MyCoolLight` classes, including parameters and return types

You should also update the `TestApp` file to show example usage that developers can reference and try themselves.
